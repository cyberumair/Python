name = "Umair"

print(name[-4:-1])
print(name[1:4]) # If negative indexing is complex for you then first converts it into positive indexing then print it

print(name[:4]) # is same as print(name[0:4]) bcz 0 is byDefault for startIndex if no index is mentioned at staring
print(name[1:]) # is same as print(name[1:-1]) bcz -1 is byDefautl for endIndex if no index is mentioned at the end as -1 is total length you can also say that length (number) is byDefault ..
