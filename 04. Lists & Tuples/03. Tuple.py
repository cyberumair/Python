# Tuple is a collection of different data Types same as list but tuple is Imutable and enclosed in ()

a = (1,345,6,78,"World") # <class 'tuple'>
print(a, type(a))

# a = (1,) # If you wanna create a tuple of single element then add a comma after it
# You can also create an empty tuple = ()

# a[0] = 333 # Not Allowed bcz tuple is Immutable same as String
