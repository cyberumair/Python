🎯 1. Add Multiple Rounds

Let the player decide:

How many rounds to play (e.g., best of 3 or 5)

Track current round number



---

🧮 2. Add Score Tracking

Keep separate scores for You and Computer

Update scores after each round

Show a scoreboard after each round and at the end



---

🔁 3. Replay Option

After the full game ends, ask:

Do you want to play again?

If yes → restart the game (reset everything)

If no → show final message and exit




---

🎨 4. Improve Terminal UX

Use clear spacing and emojis (💧🐍🔫)

Use colorama to:

Color choices (Green for win, Red for lose, Yellow for draw)

Highlight scores


Add small animations like print("Computer is choosing...") and use time.sleep(1)



---

🔍 5. Show Choices Visually

Example:

You chose: 🐍 Snake
Computer chose: 🔫 Gun


---

📦 6. Organize Logic in Functions

Break your code into:

get_user_choice()

get_computer_choice()

decide_winner()

print_scoreboard()

play_game()


This will make your code clean and reusable.


---

🧠 7. Handle Edge Cases

If someone types " S " or " g " with spaces → handle it

If they press just Enter → warn and ask again

Limit round inputs (like entering -5 or abc)



---

🏁 8. Final Results & Winner Announcement

After all rounds:

Show final winner with a celebration message

E.g., “🎉 You won the game 3 - 2!”



---

🧰 Optional Next-Level Ideas:

Add difficulty level (easy = computer mostly loses, hard = computer plays better)

Add sound (if you want later)

Save player scores to a file for high score tracking
