# 🐍 Python Projects Showcase 🚀

Welcome to my **Projects** folder in my Python repo, where I bring my coding journey to life! 💻 I'm learning Python through **Code With Harry's 10-Hour Python Tutorial** 🎥 ([watch here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrsmFxEIp5k&t=6656s)), building skills in my Kali Linux chroot on Chromebook. This folder holds my creations, from beginner experiments to practical tools, fueling my cybersecurity passion with TryHackMe, Bandit, and my portfolio ([umairshakoor.vercel.app](https://umairshakoor.vercel.app)). 😎

## 📂 Folder Structure

### 1. Learning 📚
These are my stepping stones to mastering Python basics:
- Beginner-friendly scripts to practice strings, variables, and modules.
- Examples include text case converters, password hiders, name initials generators, and friendly greeting makers.
- Perfect for learning the ropes and building logic.

### 2. Basic 🛠️
Practical tools that solve real-world problems:
- Useful scripts like command runners, email address formatters, word replacers, and file extension finders.
- Designed to be functional and showcase my growing skills in Python for cybersecurity tasks.

## Why This Matters? 🌟
This folder is my coding playground, blending learning with practical hacks. Each script reflects my progress in Python and my hacker vibe for TryHackMe and Bandit challenges. As I grow, I’ll add more tools to make this repo even more epic! 😄

## What’s Next? 🔮
Expect more projects as I dive deeper into Python, maybe even some advanced cybersecurity tools! Stay tuned for updates.
