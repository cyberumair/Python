# 🐍 My Python Adventure 🚀

Welcome to my **Python** repo, where I store all my Python code as I grow my coding skills! 💻 I'm learning through **Code With Harry's 10-Hour Python Tutorial** 🎥 ([watch it here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrsmFxEIp5k&t=6656s)), and it’s helping me master the basics! 😎

## What's Inside? 📂
- 🖥️ **Code Snippets**: Strings, variables, and modules from my learning journey.
- 🛠️ **Projects**: Simple stuff like username formatters and word counters.
- 🧠 **Progress**: Tracking my steps to becoming a Python pro!

## Why Python? 🐾
Python’s clean and powerful, perfect for coding and cybersecurity . This repo is my lab to experiment and learn! 🔍

## What’s Next? 🌟
More projects and cleaner code as I dive deeper into Python! Watch this space. 😄

*Happy coding!* 🏴‍☠️
